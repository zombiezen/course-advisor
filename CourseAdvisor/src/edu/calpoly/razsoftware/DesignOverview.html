   Project Name: Course Finder<br>
   Team Name: RAZ Software<br>
   Authors: Michael Van Beek<br>
   Version: 1.3<br>
   Date: November 27, 2011<br>
   
   <h2>Design Overview</h2>
   Course Finder is a tool to help students plan which classes to take. 
   Currently it only supports the 2007-09 Computer Science program at Cal Poly. 
   With minor data entry on edge cases, it can support all degrees at Cal Poly. 
   The software starts with a set of requirements for the major and refines a 
   list of courses that are left to take as the user checks off classes they 
   have taken. That list can be limited to classes whose requirements are met. 
   From there, the user can select classes to add to their schedule and let the 
   program suggest courses to take.<br>
   <br>
   The design was shaped by the principles of Model-View-Controller. It also 
   tries to focus on the core dynamic of how registration rules work. From the
   top down, a student is working to earn a Degree [formerly Flowchart]. A Degree
   is a collection of CourseOptions which consist of Courses you could take. Many
   CourseOptions may consist of only one Course. They can be mutually exclusive 
   or not. Courses have prerequisites, which can represent any and/or logic.
   
   <h3>Model-View-Controller</h3>
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/SchedulerView.html">SchedulerView</a>
   is an interface that defines the methods to view the model. It is currently implemented as 
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/SchedulerFrame.html">SchedulerFrame</a>
   which extends
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/JFrame.html">JFrame</a>
   <br>
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/SchedulerController.html">SchedulerController</a>
   fulfills the Controller part of MVC and extends 
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyAdapter.html">KeyAdapter</a>
   and
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/event/ActionListener.html">ActionListener</a>
   . It handles actions from the view and modifies the model as necessary.
   SchedulerModel is not actually a class, but a collection of classes which represent our model, as defined below.  
   
   <h4>SchedulerModel</h4>
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/Course.html">Course</a>
   is the most basic element of our design. Course objects contain a list of the majors that this 
   class is listed as, an a listing number, the number of units, a brief description, and sets of sets of courses that are 
   prerequisites for it. Courses will be able to determine if their prerequisites have bene met if they are passed a set of 
   courses taken. 
   <a href="https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/RAZ/wiki/wiki%3AExample%20of%20Pre-Recs">Example of Pre-Recs</a>
   <br>
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/CourseOption.html">CourseOption</a>
   objects will hold a name for the requirement (the name of the course if there is only one option), whether or not this class can 
   satisfy multiple requirements, and a list of Course objects that satisfy that requirement.
   <br>
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/Flowchart.html">Flowchart</a>
   objects will contain a set of 
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/CourseOption.html">CourseOption</a>
   objects for every requirement of the major.
   <br>
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/CourseList.html">CourseList</a>
   will contain a list of all Course objects that are relevant for the flowcharts used.
   <br>
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/CourseDecider.html">CourseDecider</a>
   will take a flowchart object and preform the calculations necessary to determine which courses have been taken, 
   which can be taken, and which need to be taken but are blocked by prerequisites.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   We have a 3 separate classes that are use GSON to build the classes.
   <br>
   <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~twwong/RAZ/edu/calpoly/razsoftware/FlowChartReader.html">FlowChartReader</a>
   is a single purpose class to fill Flowchart objects.

   <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
   
   <h3>How to store requirements</h3>
   Option A: Class / Tech Elective / GE Area<br>
   Advantages: Data is defined in the terms that the school uses.<br>
   Disadvantages: 3 (or more if implementing other flow charts) types of classes required with very similar functionality.<br>
   Option B: CourseOption<br>
   Advantages: Only one type of "requirement" to worry about<br>
   Disadvantages: Single courses still need to be wrapped in a CourseOption<br>
   Decision: Option B, because the simplicity of the design is more important to us than classes being named the same way as Cal Poly does.<br>
   
   <h3>How to represent prerequisites</h3>
   Option A: OR set of AND sets<br>
   Advantages: Represents all possible cases.<br>
   Disadvantages: Sets can get large if there are a lot of options.<br>
   Option B: AND set or OR sets<br>
   Disadvantages: You can't represent all possible cases.<br>
   Option C: Create a domain specific language<br>
   Advantages: Able to concisely represent the necessary logic.<br>
   Disadvantages: Lots of work to implement.<br>
   Decision: Option A, because it was the most efficient way of creating a system to handle prerequisites.
   
   <h3>Data Storage Format</h3>
   Option A: Use self-made data format<br>
   Advantages: Compact data structure reduces file sizes. Format would meet our specifications exactly. Fast to parse.<br>
   Disadvantages: We'd be pioneering a new concept, unforeseen difficulties could require a complete revision of the data format. Unknown data format would be annoying for anyone working on it in the future. unexpected content or volume of content could "break" it.<br>
   Option B: Use the JSON format<br>
   Advantages: Well established format. Format would not be corrupted by unexpected content or excessive volume of content<br>
   Disadvantages: Complex and relatively slow to parse. Comparatively large file size. Without the proper library, difficult to use.<br>
   Decision: Option B, because it would be more open to change in the program in the long run. The GSON library was used because of the simplicity of use.<br>

   <h3>Merge CourseList and CoursesTaken</h3>
   Option A: Keep CourseLIst and CoursesTaken as separate classes<br>
   Advantages: <br>
   Disadvantages: CourseList and CoursesTaken are both essentially wrappers around a list of courses with similar functionality<br>
   Option B: add CoursesTaken logic to CourseList<br>
   Advantages: Simplifies redundant code.<br>
   Disadvantages: Must add "single purpose" JSON code from !CoursesTaken to !CourseList<br>
   Decision: Option B, because it simplifies redundant code.<br>

   We are using Microsoft Paint for prototype design.<br>
   We use checkstyle-all-4.4.jar and 308checks.jar to syle our code.
   
   <h2>Libraries</h2>
   We are utilizing Java Swing for graphics.<br>
   We are utilizing GSON for parsing and importing data<br>
   We are utilizing GUAVA for general utility functions.<br>
   We are utilizing JUNIT for unit testing of components.
